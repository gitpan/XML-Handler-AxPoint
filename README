XML::Handler::AxPoint
=====================

This module is a port of the original AxKit presentation tool AxPoint.

It allows you to write presentations in a very simple XML format, yet
create beautiful [1] anti-aliased [2] PDF results with slide transitions,
bookmarks, images, etc.

It's a sax handler, so you require XML::SAX and XML::SAX::Writer, and it
uses PDFLib to do the PDF writing, which you can grab from CPAN, but 
requires pdflib from http://www.pdflib.com/.

Installation is simple:

  $ perl Makefile.PL
  $ make
  $ make test
  $ su
  $ make install

[1] Looks pretty rubbish on ghostview and xpdf, but lovely on Acrobat Reader.
[2] Anti Aliasing is part of the Adobe Acrobat reader, not part of this
module.
